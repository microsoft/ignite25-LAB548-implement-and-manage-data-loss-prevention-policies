## ðŸ”¥LAB548: Implement and Manage Data Loss Prevention policies

*Learn how to use Microsoft Purview DLP and Adaptive Protection to safeguard sensitive data in Copilot and AI environments.*

### Session Description

*AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot enhance productivity but can also expose sensitive information. In this session, you'll use Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to protect data across Copilot and AI environments. You'll create and test DLP policies, configure endpoint protections for AI websites, and enable Adaptive Protection to apply safeguards dynamically when user risk increases.*

### ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Create and test DLP policies that prevent Copilot from processing sensitive data
- Configure endpoint DLP to block uploads and pastes to AI websites
- Enable Adaptive Protection to adjust enforcement based on user risk

### ðŸ’» Technologies Used

1. Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
1. Microsoft Purview Adaptive Protection
1. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management

### What you'll do

In this lab, you'll:

- Create a DLP policy to keep sensitive data out of Microsoft 365 Copilot
- Test and activate the policy after simulation
- Configure an endpoint DLP policy to block uploads or pastes to AI websites
- (Optional) Use Adaptive Protection to apply safeguards based on user risk
